A Web-based Cooperative Micromouse Algorithm Simulator
============================

This web app can be used to test Micromouse algorithms in your
web browser.  It exposes a [Python Mouse
API](https://github.com/eniacluo/Micromouse/)
for controlling a simulated mouse running in a simulated maze.
You can type your mouse driver code directly in a textbox on the
web page.
